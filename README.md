[![Build badge](https://github.com/ryanmoelter/stript/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ryanmoelter/splity/actions/workflows/build.yml)

(Work in progress)

Built on [diozero](https://github.com/mattjlewis/diozero) and works with [the homebridge-opc plugin](https://github.com/plasticrake/homebridge-opc). Of course I added animated transitions on top of the normal functionality. Currently built pretty specifically for my setup, but I might make it easier to adopt soon.
